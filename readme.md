## What is Ukagaka/Ghost/SSP?
Ukagaka is a kind of Japanese desktop mascot software dating back to the early 2000s. The software itself (at least for Windows) is SSP, with the proper term for characters being Ghosts. You can go down this rabbithole by searching "Ukagawa", though there's not a whole lot in English for it.
